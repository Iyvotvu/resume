                <!-- about you -->
                As a highly motivated and industrious individual, I have a strong affinity for all things related to technology. I am currently completing my BSc Honours in Information Technology (Software Engineering). <br><br>
I completed my BSc Information Technology (Software Engineering) studies at the end of December 2022 and was ranked in the top 15% of my class throughout the full three year duration. I received an average grade of 80% throughout my BSc studies. <br><br>
In recognition of my academic achievements, the University recommended me at the prestigious Golden Key International Honour Society, after which they invited and admitted me as a full member of the Society. <br><br>
I am seeking employment at a company that will allow me to further develop my skills and knowledge in this field. I have three years of experience in Java, and have also gained proficiency in a range of other programming languages, including PHP, C++, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. <br><br>
I possess the ability to quickly learn and effectively utilize new programming languages. My portfolio includes a fully functional mobile application that I developed, which can be accessed on my GitHub account. I am confident that my skills and adaptability make me an excellent candidate for any technology-related position.
